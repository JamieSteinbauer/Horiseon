# Horiseon

Description: As per the customer's request, this webpage has been refractured to allow accessibility and optimization for search engines. By changing the divs to be more specific to their purpose, this allows the web browser to be able to distinguish between what part is what. A screen reader for instance, needs this information in order to communicate to the user. Adding alt tags also enables screenreaders to describe what the images on a webpage are. 

Organizing the CSS file in semantic order as they appear in the html file makes it easier to find the specific class or id if changes are needed to be made.
